### Artillery Wagon

No direct change, but internally increased max speed to match the increased Locomotive speed

### Storage Tank

#### Configuration

Each of these changes can be enabled (default) or disabled in the mod startup settings.

#### This is overpowered!

Yes, it is. That's probably why Wube didn't add it in the first place.
